    "All machine learning algorithms are best for classification and labelled data. The train and test data are divided and fitted into the model and passed through the machine learning. Based on the test set performance metrics, both the Random Forest Classifier and the CatBoosting Classifier seem to perform very well. They have high accuracy and F1 scores, indicating good balance between precision and recall. so, from some insights, we go for a Random Forest classifier. The Decision Tree Classifier also performs well, but not as strongly as the other two. The predicted data and test data achieved an accuracy rate of:\n",
